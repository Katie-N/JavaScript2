        <h3 class="headingText headingDivider">When does the JavaScript in this project run?</h3>
        <p id="p7">Scripts will run depending on their placement in the HTML. If the script is linked in the head then it runs before the page loads. If the script is linked inside the body it will load once the browser reaches that line. And when the script is linked just before the body closes then the script will run after the page content has loaded.</p><br>
        <h3 class="headingText headingDivider">Why can you + text with a number but not * text with a number in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p id="p8">The + operator represents concatenation when used with a string. So the number is converted to a string and combined with the other string.<br>The * operator doesn't have any sort of special relationship with strings. So it tries to literally multiply a number with a string.</p><br>
        <h3 class="headingText headingDivider">What is the difference between the <code>textContent</code> and <code>innerHTML</code> properties and why was it more appropriate to use <code>textContent</code> for this exercise?</h3>
        <p id="p9"><code>textContent</code> accesses just the text inside an element whereas <code>innerHTML</code> accesses the whole HTML element including the text and the tags. Because we only needed the words and not the actual HTML element in this exercise we used <code>textContent</code></p><br>
        <h3 class="headingText headingDivider">What is "automatic semicolon insertion" in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p id="p10">JavaScript does not require semicolons after statements. So when there is a statement left without a semicolon the interpreter will intelligently add one in. This is called automatic semicolon insertion.</p><br>
        <h3 class="headingText headingDivider">When is it OK to break a statement onto two lines in JavaScript without using special characters?</h3>
        <p id="p11">When an operator is used you can end the line with the operator and continue the statement on the next line. Ex.<br><code>let sum = a + <br>b;</code><br>Or you can break an array up after a comma. Ex. <br><code>let fruit = ['apple',<br>'orange'];</code><br>The interpreter just needs to be able to tell that the statement isn't over yet.</p><br>
        <h3 class="headingText headingDivider">How are tabs and spaces used and treated in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p id="p12">They are ignored. Whitespace has no effect in JavaScript.</p><br>
