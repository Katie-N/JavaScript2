        <p id="q1" class="questions">I know that the 3 ways to use events are as HTML attributes, as a traditional event handler, and modern event listeners. But what is the difference between <code>onclick</code> in the HTML and <code>element.onclick</code> in the JavaScript?</p>
        <p id="q2" class="questions">Is there a reason to name your functions inside event listeners which are just used to pass parameters to another function? Usually, I just see anonymous functions using arrow notation.</p>
        <p id="q3" class="questions">So capturing goes from the parents down to the target and bubbling goes from the target up to the parents? Is it one or the other? Or can you use <b>both</b> bubbling and capturing?</p>
        <p id="q4" class="questions">When you simulate a click on a button does it apply the same styling of an active button? Or is it only to trigger an event listener?</p>
