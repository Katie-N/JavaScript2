        <p id="q1" class="separate">I am working on the <a href="https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/61363ae7b36fe451adb8d5f9/view/194130156">AJAX Type Ahead project</a> and I am having trouble finding a good JSON file to work from. Is there a dedicated website that hosts open data/free-to-use JSON files? Or do people mainly make their own JSON files?</p>

        <p id="q2" class="separate">Whenever I have long code in the tables they will expand the table to go way off-page. This is not what I want. So I've been looking at different options for breaking up the code as necessary. But I would like to use CSS for this since it is made for styling things. And I have found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/where-lines-break-is-complicated-heres-all-the-related-css-and-html/">this article</a> all about it. I want the code to wrap only if absolutely necessary to keep the table from going out of the main section on my page. But if it is able to wrap the whole word to the next line that would be ideal. Right now I am making use of the <code>word-break: break-word;</code> property. Is there a better property you know of? Even with the word breaking, the table still goes off-screen a bit before the media query conditions are met.</p>

        <p id="q3" class="separate"><a href="https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/61363ae7b36fe451adb8d5f9/view/194130156">In the AJAX Type Ahead project from JavaScript30</a> I want to also match any searches where the population (or in my case, the percentage) is at or above the searched number. But I can't just return <code>state.petsPercentage.match(state.petsPercentage > regex);</code> because <code>match</code> only takes a <code>RegExp</code>. I'm stuck as to how to proceed.</p>

        <h1 class="headingText headingDivider">Array Review Questions</h1>
        <h3 class="separate">What is the difference between using "quotation marks" versus 'apostrophes' in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p id="q10" class="separate">There is no difference. They both denote strings. It is important to note that if you use ' and have an apostrophe inside the string then you will need to escape it. And vice versa for ". But if you have an apostrophe inside a double quote then you won't have to escape anything. The same thing goes for the other way around.</p>
        <h3 class="separate">What is the key difference between the innerHTML property and the textContent property?</h3>
        <p id="q11" class="separate"><code>innerHTML</code> will include the element's children's html. But  <code>textContent</code> only includes the text of the element.</p>
        <h3 class="separate">For a reference to a month, why might it make more sense to reference an array value vs. a variable?</h3>
        <p id="q12" class="separate">Because months are related to each other. So connecting them together in an array makes sense. Especially because you can also add the relationship of ordering. As in January comes before February so you can order your array as such.</p>
